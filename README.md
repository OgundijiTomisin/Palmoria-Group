## Introduction
After completing the PowerBI courses on Utiva Data Incubator Program [SQL & PowerBI], it was necessary to complete a capstone project to solidify the knowledge of PowerBI gained. 
Citing the case scenario, it says; _The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealing other issues like the gender pay gap amongst other possible issues._

## Problem Statement

1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyze the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 - Does Palmoria meet this requirement? - Show pay        distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc? Also, visualize this by regions.
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus payments to employees based on the performance rating. He handed another piece of data to you that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to - calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus) - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
