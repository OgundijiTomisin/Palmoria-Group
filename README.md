## Introduction
After completing the PowerBI courses on Utiva Data Incubator Program [SQL & PowerBI], it was necessary to complete a capstone project to solidify the knowledge of PowerBI gained. 
Citing the case scenario, it says; _The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline ‚ÄúPalmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealing other issues like the gender pay gap amongst other possible issues._

## Problem Statement

1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyze the company‚Äôs salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 - Does Palmoria meet this requirement? - Show pay        distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 ‚Äì $20,000, $20,000 ‚Äì $30,000 etc? Also, visualize this by regions.
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus payments to employees based on the performance rating. He handed another piece of data to you that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to - calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus) - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

## Skills Demostrated
The following PowerBI features were incorporated; 
- Merged Queries,
- Page Navigation, 
- Filters, 
- Tooltips, 
- Buttons, 
- Bookmarks

## Modelling

PowerBI automatically connected related tables. The Bonus Rules table is the fact table of the model. The remaining 2 dimension tables; Emp-Data and Emp + Bonus Merged table are connected to the Bonus Rules via the common column; Department.

## Data Analysis and Visuals

1.	From the image above, there are more males than females in the departments. Also, in all 3 regions, there are more males than females. The total number of males in the Palmoria Group is 465 while the total number of females is 441. Also, the total number of undisclosed genders is 40.

2.	Based on the visual above, females are more hardworking than males. Males in Palmoria Group top the chart on Average, with Poor and Very Poor ratings. While the females top the chart on Good, Very Good and Not Rated Ratings.

3.	From visual 3, males are paid more than females. The salary structure favours the males more than the females.  Males are the highest paid in all 3 regions. Males also are paid more than females in at least 7 departments. Product Management is the highest-paying department with the males earning more than the females while the Marketing department is the least-paying department.

4.	From visual 4, if a regulation is made that manufacturing companies pay their employees a minimum of $90,000, Palmoria Group cannot meet up with the standard because they still pay their employees below the average salary of $73,703. Also, Kaduna has the highest number of employees which is why they are the highest-paying region with Lagos having the lowest number of employees.

5.	Kaduna tops the table as regards the total amount to be paid by Region while the Product Management department has the highest amount to be paid per department and the Training department has the least amount to be paid. 

## Conclusion and Recommendation

1.	The total number of males in the Palmoria Group is 465 while the total number of females is 441. Also, the total number of undisclosed genders is 40.
2.	The salary structure favours males more than females.  
3.	Kaduna has the highest number of employees.

### Recommendation

1.	It is good to note that the step taken by Palmoria Group to pay the bonuses of the employees based on ratings is a good decision. It can help motivate the employees, especially the males to be more hardworking.
2.	Palmoria Group should review salaries and standardize pay.
3.	Palmoria Group should ensure that they are actively encouraging women to progress. They should make sure that female employees are asking for promotions and pay rises.
